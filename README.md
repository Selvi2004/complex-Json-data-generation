#Complex JSON Generation with Python
I have generated complex JSON files using Python's faker library and other Python utilities. The generated data includes conditional logic, nested dictionaries, arrays, and lists to simulate real-world healthcare records. The output consists of 7 different JSON files representing different aspects of patient data.

#Key Features

**Nested Structure**:
Each JSON file includes various levels of nesting, such as dictionaries inside lists, arrays with multiple dictionaries, and sub-objects within fields. These structures mimic the complexity found in real-world healthcare data.

**Conditional Parameters**:
Specific conditions are applied based on parameters such as gender. For example, in the admission_discharge.json file, only female patients have pregnancy-related admissions.
Generated Fields:

Each JSON file includes various fields like contact_information, emergency_contact, medical_history, and more. Some fields are further nested to reflect complex data structures commonly seen in healthcare data.
